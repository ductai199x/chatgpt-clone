**Date**: June 22, 2025  
**Problem**: Memory explosion during streaming (200MB ‚Üí 5GB) when images present  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **SOLVED**

**Quick Recap**: ChatGPT clone had severe memory issues during streaming responses with images. Root cause was Zustand persistence middleware serializing massive base64 image data to localStorage on every streaming chunk. Solution implemented IndexedDB file storage with file ID references and streaming-safe persistence (disabled during streaming). Result: 93% memory reduction, stable performance regardless of image count.

**Key Technical Solution**: IndexedDB storage + file IDs in state + streaming-safe persistence
**Files Modified**: 6 core files for complete file handling system overhaul
**Impact**: Production-ready fix with all functionality preserved

### üìù [memory-mcp-integration-analysis.md](./memory-mcp-integration-analysis.md)
**Date**: January 22, 2025  
**Problem**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration has multiple bugs and security issues  
**Status**: üîç **ANALYSIS COMPLETE** - Ready for fixes

**Quick Recap**: Comprehensive analysis of MCP integration feature found 15 issues ranging from critical memory leaks to missing features. Core architecture is sound but needs hardening for production. Critical issues include: SSE session manager memory leak, missing request timeouts, insecure auth token storage, and race conditions. Medium priority issues include incomplete error recovery and provider integration inconsistencies.

**Key Findings**: 3 production blockers, 3 high-priority issues, 6 medium/low priority bugs, 3 missing features
**Files Analyzed**: 5 core MCP files (service, proxy, settings, UI components)
**Impact**: Feature functional but needs stability and security hardening before production

## Instructions for Future Memory Files

When creating new memory files:

1. **Descriptive naming**: Use format `memory-[problem-domain]-[solution-approach].md`
2. **Structure**: Include problem, investigation, solution, results, lessons learned
3. **Status tracking**: Mark as in-progress, solved, or failed
4. **File references**: List all files modified with brief descriptions
5. **Update this index**: Add entry with quick recap for easy reference
