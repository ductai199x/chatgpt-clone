## Memory Files

**Date**: June 22, 2025  
**Problem**: Memory explosion during streaming (200MB ‚Üí 5GB) when images present  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **SOLVED**

**Quick Recap**: ChatGPT clone had severe memory issues during streaming responses with images. Root cause was Zustand persistence middleware serializing massive base64 image data to localStorage on every streaming chunk. Solution implemented IndexedDB file storage with file ID references and streaming-safe persistence (disabled during streaming). Result: 93% memory reduction, stable performance regardless of image count.

**Key Technical Solution**: IndexedDB storage + file IDs in state + streaming-safe persistence
**Files Modified**: 6 core files for complete file handling system overhaul
**Impact**: Production-ready fix with all functionality preserved

### üìù [memory-mcp-integration-analysis.md](./memory-mcp-integration-analysis.md)
**Date**: January 22, 2025 ‚Üí **Updated**: June 22, 2025  
**Problem**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration analysis - corrected with realistic usage assessment  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE + FIXED** - Production ready

**Quick Recap**: **REVISED ANALYSIS**: Original assessment found "15 critical bugs" but realistic usage analysis revealed only 1 minor UX issue. Applied context-driven investigation approach, examining actual user behavior vs theoretical edge cases. Fixed the one real issue: added 1-minute timeouts to prevent UI hanging when users configure unresponsive MCP servers.

**Key Findings**: 0 production blockers (down from 3), 1 UX improvement implemented, most "issues" were non-problems in real usage
**Files Modified**: 1 file (`app/api/mcp-proxy/route.js`) + updated investigation guidelines in CLAUDE.md
**Impact**: Feature is production ready as-is, with improved UX for edge case of unresponsive MCP servers
**Lesson Learned**: Always analyze issues in context of actual usage patterns, not theoretical scenarios

## Instructions for Future Memory Files

When creating new memory files:

1. **Descriptive naming**: Use format `memory-[problem-domain]-[solution-approach].md`
2. **Structure**: Include problem, investigation, solution, results, lessons learned
3. **Status tracking**: Mark as in-progress, solved, or failed
4. **File references**: List all files modified with brief descriptions
5. **Update this index**: Add entry with quick recap for easy reference

### Template for new memory files:
```markdown
